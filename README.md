# edX LinuxFoundationX LFD111x Building a RISC-V CPU Core

## Course Overview

Building a RISC-V CPU Core (LFD111x) is designed for anyone with a technical inclination who
is interested in learning more about hardware. Whether you are new to digital logic or are a
seasoned veteran, students will take away new skills that can be applied immediately. No prior
knowledge of digital logic design is required.

This is a crash course in digital logic design and basic CPU microarchitecture. Using the
Makerchip online integrated development environment (IDE), you will implement everything from
logic gates to a simple, but complete, RISC-V CPU core. You will be amazed by what you can
do using freely-available online tools for open source development. You will familiarize yourself
with a number of emerging technologies supporting an open-source hardware ecosystem,
including RISC-V, Transaction-Level Verilog, and the online Makerchip IDE.

LFD111x is a hands-on experience with RISC-V and modern circuit design tools. You will walk
away with fundamental skills for a career in logic design, and you will position yourself on the
forefront by learning to use the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog language extension (even if
you don’t already know Verilog).

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will learn about:
● Digital logic design (combinational and sequential logic)
● RISC-V (RV32I) instruction set architecture
● Basic CPU microarchitecture
● Transaction-Level Verilog basics
● Makerchip online IDE

## Knowledge/Skills Prerequisites

Anyone with a technical inclination can successfully complete the workshop. No prior knowledge
of digital logic design is required.

You may want to consider first taking Introduction to RISC-V (LFD110x) prior to this course,
though this is not a prerequisite.

## Exercises/System Prerequisites

The lab environment (Makerchip) is entirely online. The only system requirement is a web
browser.

## Audience

This course is designed for anyone with a technical inclination who is interested in learning
more about hardware.

## Course Instructors

As founder of Redwood EDA, Steve Hoover is fostering an open-source silicon ecosystem
through numerous technologies including the WARP-V CPU core generator with support for
RISC-V. His main focus is design methodology and tools enabled by Transaction-Level Verilog
(TL-Verilog), available to all at makerchip.com. He is also the lead developer of the 1st CLaaS
open-source framework for cloud FPGAs. Steve holds a BS in electrical engineering summa
cum laude from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an MS in computer science from the
University of Illinois. He has designed numerous components for high-performance server CPUs
and network architectures for DEC, Compaq, and Intel.
