# Arithmetic Logic Unit

Now, you have source values to operate on, so letâ€™s create the ALU. The ALU is much like our initial calculator circuit. It computes, for each possible instruction, the result that it would produce. It then selects, based on the actual instruction, which of those results is the correct one.

At this point, we are only going to implement support for the instructions in our test program. Since branch instructions do not produce a result value, we only need to support ADDI (which adds the immediate value to source register 1) and ADD (which adds the two source register values). Check the box one you completed this step.

Note an error in the diagram. The immediate value is used in place of op2 (src2), not op1 (src1).

Use a structure like the following to assign the ALU $result in a single assignment expression for ADDI and ADD instructions:

$result[31:0] =
    $is_addi ? $src1_value + $imm :
    ...
